# What is Yiski
A bot to replace the original idea of devOS Core for the devOS: Sanity Edition server. Also used to try to learn Python and Revolt stuff for fun. Discord **should** be secondary. 
- Uses Python 3.10, but 3.9+ should work.

**This is something I'm doing just for fun and to learn Python, excuse anything shitty going on.**
