# What is Yiski
A bot to replace the original idea of devOS Core for the devOS: Sanity Edition server. Also used to try to learn ~~Python~~ Kotlin for fun.
- ~~Uses Python 3.10, but 3.9+ should work.~~ Now using Kotlin!

**This is something I'm doing just for fun and to learn ~~Python~~ Kotlin, excuse anything shitty going on.**
