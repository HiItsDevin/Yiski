# Yiski Plugin Loader

WIP

## Idea
Since there is already a modularization effort for Yiski, why not give it an actual plugin loader where it can load any 
Yiski Plugin jars? That way, with a simple reboot of the bot, it can load any modules given to it to extend 
functionality of the bot.

more will be typed here later, it is 07:47 and i am tired and this still needs to be talked about. wah.
